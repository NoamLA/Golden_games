# Golden_games

My first python project 

The goal of this project was to familiarize with various python Packages, building Functions and a Class. 
I've created a simple game of detecting face and a gesture 
using the computer's camera. In the next stage the photos are mesured at 4 different points to calculate golden ratio
 of the face using 4 points.
I used OpenCV and different crawlers for this project.

The notebook " my first python project - are you golden? " describes the 
code and working process. the packages and the game works only locally.

Enjoy!
