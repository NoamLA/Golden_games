# Golden_games

My first python project 

The goal was to familiarize with various packages. 
I created a simple game of detecting face and a gesture 
using the computer camera. Then calculating golden ratio
 of the face using 4 points.
I used OpenCV and different crawlers for this project.

The notebook " my first python project - are you golden? " describes the 
code and working orocess. the packages and the game works only locally.

Enjoy!
